# Intestinal Crypt Modeling Project

This project focuses on building stochastic models to estimate the fixation probability under mutant invasion in intestinal crypts.

* **Supplementary Material.pdf**: Detailed documentation containing the mathematical background and algorithms used in both the multi-dimensional and one-dimensional models.
* **create_figures/**: Python scripts used to generate the figures presented in the poster.
* **multi-dimensional/**: MATLAB implementations of the multi-dimensional solvers and simulations.
* **one-dimensional/**: MATLAB implementations of the one-dimensional solvers and simulations.
